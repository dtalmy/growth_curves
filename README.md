# growth_curves
developing software for fitting dynamic models to lab growth curves

simple use case:

After cloning the repo, cd to /growth_curves/src/ and run 

python model_selection.py

The script will run model fitting on two datasets in /growth_curves/data/algv/ and save a pdf with output to /growth_curves/figures/Model_tester.pdf
